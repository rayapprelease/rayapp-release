        <p>
          RayApp Release was founded in 1990 with a singular mission: to support
          the music release of independent artists and empower them to get their
          music heard by the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For over three decades, we have been at the forefront of the music
          distribution industry, helping artists navigate the complex landscape
          of releasing their work. We believe that every artist deserves a
          chance to be heard, regardless of their background or resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools for music
          production, mixing, mastering, and label release. We connect artists
          with major streaming platforms as well as regional stores, ensuring
          maximum reach for their creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join us in our journey to make music accessible to everyone,
          everywhere.
